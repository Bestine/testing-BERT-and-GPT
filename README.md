AI ethics principles refer to the guidelines and values that should be considered when designing, developing, and deploying AI systems. There are several key AI ethics principles that are widely recognized and discussed in the field. They are:

##Fairness
Ensuring that AI systems do not discriminate against certain groups of people, and that they provide equal opportunities and benefits to all.

## Explainability
Making sure that AI systems are transparent and that their decision-making process can be understood by humans.

## Safety
Ensuring that AI systems do not cause harm, and that they have appropriate safeguards in place to prevent errors and mitigate the consequences of any errors that do occur.

## Privacy 
Protecting the personal information and data of individuals, and ensuring that AI systems are used in a way that respects the privacy of individuals.

## Reliability
Ensuring that AI systems are robust and reliable, and that they can be trusted to perform their intended tasks.

## Lineage
Ensuring that the origin of data and the decisions made by AI systems are traceable and understandable.

## Human control
Ensuring that AI systems are designed to be under human control and that they do not have the ability to harm humans.

## Human-centered
Ensuring that AI systems are designed with human values, needs, and well-being in mind.

There are a variety of metrics that can be used to evaluate the adherence to each of the above key AI ethics principles. Here's a general overview of some of the metrics that can be used for each principle:

## Fairness
Metrics such as demographic parity, equal opportunity difference, and false positive and false negative rate difference can be used to evaluate the fairness of AI systems.

## Explainability
Metrics such as feature importance, feature occlusion, saliency maps, decision path visualization, and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) can be used to evaluate the explainability of AI systems.

## Safety
Metrics such as failure rate, criticality, and hazard rate can be used to evaluate the safety of AI systems.

## Privacy
Metrics such as differential privacy, k-anonymity, and l-diversity can be used to evaluate the privacy of AI systems.

## Reliability
Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score can be used to evaluate the reliability of AI systems.

## Lineage
Metrics such as data lineage, model lineage, version lineage and deployment lineage can be used to evaluate the lineage of AI systems.

## Human control
Metrics such as human intervention rate, human oversight and human approval rate can be used to evaluate the human control of AI systems.

## Human-centered
Metrics such as human-centered evaluation, user studies, and human-AI interaction metrics can be used to evaluate the human-centeredness of AI systems.
